# push_swap_tester

Clone the repository to your push_swap directory, cd into it and use

```bash
bash tester.sh lower_range upper_range number_of_cases
```

to test your push_swap.

Example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zaperfish/push_swap_tester
bash tester.sh 10 20 7
```
This will test your push_swap with stack sizes in the range 10-20 with 7 testcases for each stack size.
